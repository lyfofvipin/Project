# Projects
## I keep all my projects in this repository which I code in any language.

[Indentation](https://github.com/vipin3699/Projects/tree/master/indentation "Indentation")

This project is written in python, It read a C file without indentation and create another file after fixing indentation name of the new file is same but we add IF at the end of the file name.

[21-sticks](https://github.com/vipin3699/Projects/tree/master/21-sticks "21-sticks")

This small code is to play a fair game against the computer.

[C Interpreter](https://github.com/vipin3699/Projects/tree/master/C_interpreter "C Interpreter")

This project is for some lazy programmers those who want to directly code without formalities in C language :)
